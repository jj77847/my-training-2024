Alright! Hereâ€™s the plan ðŸ”¨ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

Youâ€™ve outlined three structured workouts, each with specific exercises, rep schemes, and summary features. Youâ€™re looking to:
	1.	Select a workout from a dropdown
	2.	Display its structure, exercises, rep scheme, and totals
	3.	Track progress weekly
	4.	Show pie charts for visual summary
	5.	Highlight max weekly totals and favorite exercises

Letâ€™s break this into components for a web app. Iâ€™ll give you a working prototype using HTML + CSS + JavaScript using Chart.js for the visual parts ðŸ“Š

Weâ€™ll create:
	â€¢	A dropdown menu to choose between the 3 workouts
	â€¢	A summary display section for exercises + reps
	â€¢	A chart to visualize weekly performance
	â€¢	A data object to simulate weekly values for now
