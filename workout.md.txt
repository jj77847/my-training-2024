Use data above to identify 3 workouts then then I’d like to have those as labels for drop-down menus for each of them and then to show the exercises and rep schemes and totals as one unit therefore I can track progress and ideally in a pie chart format see clear weekly improvements and then four by chance highlightingmax reps weekly totals for that month and favourite exercises I don’t know list any improvements
